- 👋 Hi, I’m Hein Thet Aung
- 👀 "I've always loved video games and have been curious about how they're made since childhood. I dedicated my free time to developing them. I've always wanted Burmese developers to create games with Burmese themes, but they seem to focus only on profit-driven ventures like gambling apps. Thus, I aim to create quality video games with engaging mechanics and compelling narratives.
- 🌱I have C sharp background in unity. I’m currently learning Godot- a light weight opensource game engine with robust features and growing community. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video game projects

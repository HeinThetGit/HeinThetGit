Hi, I'm **Hein Thet Aung** 👋

🎮 **Passionate Game Developer & Problem Solver**
I've loved video games since childhood and have always been fascinated by how they're made. I dedicate my free time to creating games that blend engaging mechanics with compelling narratives, often inspired by Burmese culture. I aim to craft experiences that go beyond quick profits or outsourcing games that leave an impact. Even if a project doesn’t reach completion, I embrace it as a learning journey to improve the next one.

💻 **Technical Background**
* Experienced in **C# with Unity**.
* Currently exploring **Godot 4**, a lightweight open-source game engine, focusing on optimizing performance for low-end devices while building immersive 3D worlds.
* Skilled in implementing systems like **quests, combat mechanics, magic spells, save/load systems**, and more, drawing inspiration from games like *Elder Scrolls*, *Minecraft*, and TPS shooters.

🌱 **Learning & Growth**
I’m continuously learning game development, programming, and design techniques to create high quality, mobile friendly games. I enjoy experimenting with mechanics and refining gameplay to make each project better than the last.

🤝 **Collaboration & Contact**
I’m open to collaborating on video game projects and exchanging ideas.

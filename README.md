- 👋 Hi, I'm Hein Thet Aung
- 👀 "I've always loved video games and have been curious about how they're made since childhood. I dedicated my free time to developing them. I've always wished that Burmese developers would create games inspired by our culture, but it seems like many are only interested in projects like gambling apps that bring in quick money. Some choose to work as outsourced developers for foreign companies, while others prefer teaching courses for a paycheck instead of focusing on creating outstanding games. Thus, I aim to create quality video games with engaging mechanics and compelling narratives.I know it may seem like a lot. But any way I going to try it. Even if its for nothing in the end like the projects I've abandoned, I believe I will gain experience form it and help me leverage creating another game on different game engine.
- 🌱I have C sharp background in unity. I’m currently learning Godot- a light weight opensource game engine with robust features and growing community. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video game projects

- ⚡ Fun fact: Videogame is one of the mediums that can shape perceptions and have a significant impact on how a country is viewed by people from other countries. They serve as windows into a country's culture, values, and creativity.
